            It is toward the end of the year, and depending on whether life gave you a couple of goodies or bads, you may be counting towards
            the end of the year with a hum, or a grumble. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Back in Matt 7:24 - 27, Jesus was giving a story of two houses. Little details of the houses or their owners is given to give this story a complete
            setting, however we can be creative and assume they were men of means, and built their houses in a scenic place overlooking the sea. Just note, this from a 
            geographer, not all beaches are made of sand. In some places, the land meets the sea through a cliff! 
        </p>

        <p>
            Now, whether rich or poor, building a house is no light investment. Good houses for that matter. 
            We are not talking of ramshackles here, where the mere banging of a door threatens its stability more than the wind. Not that kind. The protagonists 
            in the story were building solid houses. Let's assume they were each building a storey house, designed with finesse, well furnished and a sea front to complete 
            the view. That's no cheap undertaking, don't you think?
        </p>

        <p>
            Except one of the protagonists, let's call him Mr S hardly bothered with the foundations. His counterpart, Mr R, same design, costs and material, built 
            his on hard rock. 
        </p>

        <p>
            They say the calm before the storm. Mr S had his tranquility thrown out of the window when an unexpected hurricane blew away the roof and flattened his 
            house in no time. Mr R on the other hand slept like a baby irrespective of the howling winds and the torrents of water running against the house. He only 
            woke up to assess the situation in the morning as the sun broke over the horizon. 
        </p>

        <p>
            <q>The storm is over</q> Mr R must have mused.
        </p>

        <p>
            <blockquote>
                24 “Everyone then who hears these words of mine and does them will be like a wise man who built his house on the rock. 
                    25 And the rain fell, and the floods came, and the winds blew and beat on that house, but it did not fall, because 
                    it had been founded on the rock. 26 And everyone who hears these words of mine and does not do them will be 
                    like a foolish man who built his house on the sand. 27 And the rain fell, and the floods came, 
                    and the winds blew and beat against that house, and it fell, and great was the fall of it.” Matthew 7:24-27
            </blockquote>
        </p>

        <p>
            Now this story of two similar storey buildings came at the tail-end of Jesus' Sermon on the Mount. It was after a lengthy series of parables each with 
            its own lesson the Lord ended with the parable above. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Like the way architects follow a plan, the Sermon on the Mount was a blueprint on which we are to build our life on. Avoiding Jesus' teachings, some of 
            them in the Sermon of the Mount, is akin to building castles in the air. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Now that we began by talking about the closure of the year, how is your house standing? Mine? Better not ask.
            <br>
            <br>
            Jesus equated the spiritual condition of a man with a house. See the story in Matt 12: 43 - 45. If a man's spiritual condition was good, it was 
            equated to a good house--standing tall and peaceful. Even though foundations were not part of this story, Jesus elucidated that some other factors 
            could make a house, read <em>spirit</em> of a man unlivable. In this case, demons. But, I don't have the capacity to talk about this today. Nevertheless, 
            take the standing of a house as to mean that person's spiritual condition, okay?
            <br>
            <br>
            Going back to the parable in Matthew 7, the house on the rock represented a peron with a well-founded spiritual life. Conversely, for the house on 
            sand, this was the quintessential person with a shaky, unstable spiritual condition.
            <br>
            <br>
            We've got the point alright. Strong spiritual foundation equals to spiritual stability. Bad spiritual foundations equal to
            spiritual instability. 
            <br>
            <br>
            One more thing. It's not just how deep the foundation goes to be strong. The material also counts. Not just any rock can make
            a foundation. Some rocks are sturdier than others. Some look like rock, but have too much air and will easily crumble at any pressure. Not good for
            a house. Therefore, the quality of teaching you get for your spiritual life matters just as well. Not every teaching is beneficial for your spirit.
            <br>
            <br>
            Why did Christ equate a man's spirit with a house? Me thinks because it is both a heavy and worthwhile investment. At the end of the day, what do 
            you fall back to? Same thing for handling life's affairs, there is always something we fall back to for comfort, rest and revitalization! Moreover, your 
            spirit is not some cheap commodity that should be experimented with. Christ asked, <q>What can a man give in return for his soul?</q> (Matt 16:26).
            <br>
            <br> 
            Answer: <q>Nothing!</q>
            <br>
            <br>
            The condition of your spirit will be the threshold that God uses to enter into heaven. If Christ has not redeemed it, eternal damnation awaits. 
            <br>
            <br>
            But then before the spirit reaches the creator it has to face some things down here. And some of them are everything but friendly.
            <br>
            <br>
            Therefore, after all is said and still undone, how do I make my house strong? For one, consider carefully what you listen to, especially
            on matters spiritual. As mentioned earlier, not all spiritual teaching is profitable. 
        </p>

        <p>
            <blockquote>
                1 Beloved, do not believe every spirit, 
                but test the spirits to see whether they are from God, 
                for many false prophets have gone out into the world. 1 John 4:1
            </blockquote>
        </p>

        <p>
            Secondly, guard that house, nay spirit. When a demon is chased out of a person's spirit, it goes to the nether world. But then it becomes home sick and misses 
            it former home-sweet-not-so-home anymore. In order to make an uninvited comeback, it invites other more deadly spirits to ensure its territory does not fall so 
            easily again. So be on your guard. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Finally, meditating on the word of God. Josh was told, <q>meditate on the word, day and night</q> 
        </p>

        <p>
            <blockquote>
                1 Blessed is the man who walks not in the counsel of the wicked,
                nor stands in the way of sinners, 
                nor sits in the seat of scoffers;
                2 but his delight is in the law of the LORD, 
                and on his law he meditates day and night. Psalms 1:1-2
            </blockquote>
        </p>

        <p>
            And of course, remembering this was the last parable of the sermon on the mount, practising all that Jesus has spoken in his word.
            
            <h2>The <q>A</q>Architect</h2>
            
            Now someone may ask, <q>I have always observed all commandments, those in the Sermon on the Mount included.</q>
            <br>
            <br>
            <q>Now you are telling me to practice them. I don't have anything new to add.</q>
            <br>
            <br>
            <q>Furthermore, I am getting tired of this do's and don'ts. I am already good enough!</q>
            <br>
            <br>
            Okay. I can see you have your do's and don'ts checked and crossed out. 
            <br>
            <br>
            You are like that Mr R who had his house well-founded and planned from the word go. You are like those 'A' Architects who get the principles 
            right the first time round. However, the spiritual class is a mixture of all kinds of people, and there are some who don't grasp the 
            concepts easily and fast as you do. 
            <br>
            <br>  
            They need help to start and stay strong. Your help. 
            <br>
            <br>
            If gifted, how about casting out some demons that make other people's spiritual condition untenable? 
            <br>
            <br>
            Anyone? 
            <br>
            <br>
            Someone?
            <br>
            <br>
            How about you help to solve, or make other people's 'spiritual' foundations better? Then you
            will be called greatest in the kingdom of heaven. 
            <blockquote>
                19 Therefore whoever relaxes one of the least of these commandments and teaches others to do the same will be called least in the kingdom of heaven, 
                 but whoever does them and teaches them will be called great in the kingdom of heaven. Matthew 5:19
            </blockquote>

            Still on the same script, but on a different line, this article may be reaching out to people who are in a spiritual mess much like Mr S's house that was 
            demolished by the hurricane. It's hard for this writer to offer any solutions, but pray to God, who can offer to bring those rubbles up and standing. 
            <br>
            <br>
            As I finish on the same thought, I know of a good neighbour whose house had a huge, strikingly visible crack flowing across the entire length 
            of the house. So much so that she would put crumbles of newspaper to prevent snakes, spiders, centipedes and what not from making a home in the 
            humungous crack that split the house right in the middle. As if that was not enough, one half of the house drifting further from the other at a 
            slightly faster pace. Good things happened to her anyway. One of her children rebuilt her house, and now it rivals any other modern bungalow in 
            the neighbourhood.
            <br>
            <br>
            This same script could be yours if you turn to the Lord for some mending. In the meantime, I shall keep making my house strong and seeing to it others 
            hold true to the plumbline, right from the foundations!
